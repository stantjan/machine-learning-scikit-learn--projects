This project is about analyzing and making predictions of DoA index (Depth of Anesthesia)
from given patient data.

Feature selection uses SelectKBest algorithms.

The machine learning algorithms in this model are: first using Neural Networks to train the
model using training data. Then using kMeans to classify and predict the test data.

The model is then evaluated for accuracy, precision and recall.
